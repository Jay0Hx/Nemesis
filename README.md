<h1 align="center">What is 'PredatorV1'?:</a></h1>
(CSP v0.1.79 ONLY)

Predator V1 is a new version of Alien2 (Linked above) which was an amazing tool for manipulating AC physics related features such as power, handling, grip, etc... CSP developers removed the usage of certain aspects which temporarily disabled the use of AlienV2. PredatorV1 is the new project filling the shoes of the previous developer, the latest version is tried and tested to be working on 0.1.79 and below which is currently the latest stable release of CSP.

<h1 align="center">Installation Guide:</a></h1> 

   ```sh
REQUIREMENTS:
   1. WinRar or a RAR file manager or your choice.
   2. Content Manager for Assetto Corsa.
   3. An injector of your choice (I use cheat engine).

   1️⃣ > Download the latest release from this GitHub repo.
   2️⃣ > Extract the contents to your desktop.
   3️⃣ > Rename the new file to 'predator'.
   4️⃣ > Navigate to your Assetto Corsa directory, usually located at 'C:\SteamLibrary\steamapps\common\assettocorsa'
   5️⃣ > Now head into 'Apps', then, 'lua' and drag and drop the 'predator' file into this directory.
   6️⃣ > Load into a sesion of your choice on CSP version 0.1.79 or lower.
   7️⃣ > Use cheat engine to inject the provided DLL into the process.
   ```
+ After completing the steps above you are good to go, navigate to the side bar of AC and open 'predator'. This will present you with the menu in game and you can begin ruining peoples days.
+ Your final file structure should look something like this. You can ignore the Test files they are placeholders.
